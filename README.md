# Play-detective-with-machine-learning-
This machine learning project identifies who may be a person of interest in the Enron Scandal. 
It's the final project of the machine learning course for the data analyst nanodegree program.

Start at the poi_id.py file and read the comments to see how the code works. To summarize, the data is first loaded from 
the final_project_data.pkl file, outliers are cleaned out, new features are added and three machine learning algorithms
including Adaboost, Decision Tree Classifier and SVM are used to train and test the data and performance of each algorithm 
are recorded.
